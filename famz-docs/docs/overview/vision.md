# Vision & Mission

**Famz Yield** aims to unlock **BTC-based yield** on the CORE Blockchain by combining **Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC)** and **Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs)** into a single, yield-bearing token: **lstBTC**.

We believe that:

- BTC holders should earn yield **without sacrificing liquidity**.
- LST stakers should be able to **participate in BTC-equivalent yield strategies** while continuing to earn staking rewards.
- Yield distribution should be **fair, predictable, and transparent**, which is why we use a **24-hour epoch system**:
  - Depositors start earning yield from the next epoch.
  - Withdrawals are processed after the current epoch ends.
- Both BTC and LST-based yields should be **tracked separately** and distributed proportionally based on each depositorâ€™s asset mix.
- DeFi should be **secure, transparent, and accessible** to all.

Our mission is to build the **most trusted BTC yield layer** on CORE by:

1. Providing **dual-asset yield** for wBTC and LST deposits.
2. Enforcing a clear **epoch-based accounting model** for predictable rewards.
3. Maintaining **full transparency** through open-source smart contracts and verifiable yield calculations.
