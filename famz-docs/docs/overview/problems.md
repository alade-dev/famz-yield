# Problems on CORE Blockchain

1. **Underutilized BTC Holdings**

   - Many BTC holders on CORE keep their wBTC idle, missing opportunities to earn yield.

2. **Fragmented Yield & Staking**

   - Liquid Staking Token (LST) holders (e.g., stCORE) lack integrated strategies that combine BTC-equivalent yield with staking rewards.
   - Users often need to choose between BTC-based lending and LST staking, rather than benefiting from both.

3. **Liquidity Locking**

   - Existing yield vaults frequently require long lock-up periods, limiting flexibility.
   - Lack of **epoch-based models** means users may face unpredictable or inefficient yield distribution schedules.

4. **High Complexity for Users**

   - To optimize yield, users must juggle multiple protocols, track different APYs, and manually claim/reinvest rewards.
   - No unified solution currently exists on CORE to **deposit multiple asset types once** and automatically receive proportional BTC-based yield.

5. **Lack of Transparent Distribution Models**
   - Some protocols have opaque yield mechanisms, making it unclear how rewards are calculated or distributed.
   - Without **clear epoch-based accounting**, smaller depositors risk unfair yield allocation.
